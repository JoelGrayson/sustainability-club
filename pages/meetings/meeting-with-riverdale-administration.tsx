		<p>Here&apos;s the deal: transportation is the number one sector of
		emissions. Electric school buses have significantly lower emissions and
		are better for student health. Studies have even shown that students who
		don&apos;t inhale diesel emissions score better on math and english tests and
		have a lower chance of developing asthma and heart issues.</p>
		<h3 id="meeting-agenda">Meeting Agenda</h3>
		<p>1. Benefits</p>
		<ul>
		<li><blockquote>
		<p>Environmental - transportation is the #1 sector of emissions.
		Electric school buses have significantly lower emissions.</p>
		</blockquote></li>
		<li><blockquote>
		<p>Student health - children are especially vulnerable to
		asthma-inducing and carcinogenic diesel exhaust. Pollution levels are
		12x higher in a diesel bus than ambient levels, impacting student&apos;s
		health and academic performance.</p>
		</blockquote></li>
		<li><blockquote>
		<p>Innovation and public relations - NYS has declared all public school
		buses will be electric by 2035. We can be a leading school of innovation
		if we transition now as one of the first private schools.</p>
		</blockquote></li>
		</ul>
		<p>2. Financing</p>
		<ul>
		<li><blockquote>
		<p>Different manufacturing companies (Lion Electric, NESCO Buses
		offering Thomas Built Buses, and Blue Bird)</p>
		</blockquote></li>
		<li><blockquote>
		<p>Incentives (e.g. ConEd, Volkswagen, etc)</p>
		</blockquote></li>
		</ul>
		<p>3. Working with others - SuperSelby, other hill schools, parents</p>
		<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>

		<p>Dear All,</p>
		<p>It was a pleasure meeting with you today, and I am excited that we
		are working together.</p>
		<p>I received a quote this morning from Frank Pisapia for two buses, a
		representative from NESCO Bus, one of Selby&apos;s current bus suppliers I
		spoke with last week. Since Dr. Nicholson-Flynn explained our lack of
		control over Selby, I believe starting small may be a good strategy.
		Having support from all three schools will strengthen our case. The
		three Hill Schools can then share two buses, alternating which schools
		have them every year.</p>
		<p><a
		href="http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O-SL5f3m44BfvTCepBPWwfSZQpj5CVYa704hCc4J-74"><u>Here
		are my financial calculations</u></a> based on Mr. Pisapia&apos;s quote for
		two buses, a charging station, and the incentives listed below. The two
		buses cost $750,000 upfront, but once we apply incentives (next section)
		and share the price with the other Hill schools, Riverdale only needs to
		subsidize <strong>$23,000</strong> <strong>total</strong>. Also, each
		electric school bus saves $50,000 a year in fuel and maintenance costs.
		Additionally, the Vehicle To Grid program generates $3,000 each year per
		vehicle under regular conditions. The profits of <strong>1.3 million
		dollars</strong> from this program over 12 years for two buses can
		potentially be split between the three Hill Schools and SuperSelby.</p>
		<p><strong>Incentives</strong></p>
		<p>The Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust (EMT) pays
		<strong>$120,000</strong> per vehicle. To receive this incentive, Selby
		must destroy a diesel bus (old buses are best). Here is a <a
		href="https://dec.vermont.gov/sites/dec/files/aqc/mobile-sources/documents/eBus_Pilot_FAQ_20190812.pdf"><u>FAQ
		about the Pilot Program</u></a>.</p>
		<p>The American Jobs Plan signed on 11/15/21 allocates 2.5 billion
		specifically for electric school buses. Regulations and the
		<strong>amount of money is pending</strong> and will be decided around
		mid-February. Read more <a
		href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
		<p>Con Edison will <strong>pay for the charging infrastructure</strong>
		(likely provided by Nuvve Corp) in exchange for using the buses as
		batteries to stabilize the grid.</p>
		<p>The NY state subsidizes electric school buses through the NYSERDA
		Battery Electric Vehicle program. They paid <strong>$120,000</strong>
		per bus for White Plains. Read more <a
		href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/10452"><u>here</u></a> and <a
		href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Truck-Voucher-Program"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
		<p>These are the biggest incentives I could find. There are more local
		incentivesâ€¦.</p>
		<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
		<ol type="1">
		<li><p>Meet with Fieldston&apos;s and Horace Mann&apos;s administrators to get
		them on board. Mr. Schultz already knows the head of transportation at
		Horace Mann. I will find an appropriate administrator from
		Fieldston.</p></li>
		<li><p>Then meet with Selby.</p></li>

		<p>Subject: EV Bus quote</p>
		<p>To: Joel Grayson &lt;jgrayson24@riverdale.edu&gt;</p>
		<p>Morning Joel,</p>
		<p>Attached you will find the requested quote for our 2023 Electric Bus.
		Please review the quote and feel free to reach out with any questions.
		If you would like I can set up a meeting with myself and our Sales
		Manager Anthony to meet with you and anyone else on your team in order
		to answer any questions you might have. Also I have not shared any of
		this or our discussions with Lee at Selby but can definitely share this
		with him if you would like me too. Again please feel free to reach out
		and let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.</p>
		<p>Thanks Again for the opportunity,</p>
		<p>Frank Pisapia</p>
