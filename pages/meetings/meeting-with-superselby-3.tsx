                <p>Questions for Mr. Klingensmith</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The cost of $32,000 per year is a price estimate including the
                            NYSERDA (AKA NYTVIP) program and potential other grants? Is the 3%
                            annual increase rate fixed or open to change? If so, I should change my
                            financing spreadsheet. I would appreciate it if you could help verify my
                            numbers as I have been sharing them with administrators. I think the
                            more financial details we can figure out the easier it will be to
                            convince SuperSelby.</p>
