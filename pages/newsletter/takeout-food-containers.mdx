# Takeout Food Containers

Hi Upper School!



In this week’s email, we wanted to address the environmental impact of **single-use food containers,** an issue many of us are not familiar with, but one that is important to discuss when it comes to creating a more sustainable world. 



The amount of plastic used in these disposable containers, and the frequency of their usage has detrimental effects on the environment. In fact, disposable food containers account for almost 30% of all solid waste generated in cities across the world! 

But don’t worry, there is a solution! Companies like **DeliverZero** want to eliminate this waste by introducing reusable food containers to restaurants. DeliverZero partners with restaurants to provide reusable containers, which customers can order food in, and then return after they are done using them. 



On the general topic of food waste, another initiative, **Too Good to Go**, helps sell restaurants’ excess food that would have been thrown away otherwise.  



We strongly encourage researching and utilizing sustainable solutions like DeliverZero or Too Good to Go, and if you want to learn more about those two specifically, feel free to browse their websites:
