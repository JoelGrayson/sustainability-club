# Hydroponics

Hydroponics is a method of producing plants without the use of soil, while instead using nutrient rich water. Hydroponics can produce yield three times faster than traditional farming methods, while using ten times less water. In areas where the nutrients in the soil have been depleted, hydroponics can be used in these areas to still produce yield. Hydroponics are a great alternative to traditional farming because it does not cause agricultural runoff, and the plants can be grown during all seasons of the year, as using led lights serves as an alternative to the sun during the winter months. As global warming continues to cause the deterioration of our environment, it is becoming increasingly important to find sustainable ways that can produce food to support the growing human population, without negatively affecting our environment.


For my independent research, I am constructing a hydroponic system, using the nutrient film technique, to produce yield (lettuce) for the cafeteria, and to teach younger Riverdale students about the importance of sustainability. My system is set up on a cafeteria cart, and it has connecting PVC pipes, where the water flows down into a reservoir. In order for the plants to receive their necessary nutrients in the system, I added different nutrient solutions, and I installed led lights on the cart, so the plants could undergo photosynthesis!
