The Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center’s Foodscape reports provide a view of the food environment in New York City neighborhoods, with a focus on the Riverdale/Fieldston neighborhood. Updated biannually since 2020, these reports offer a data point on demographic trends, food accessibility, food consumption, and health. 

Riverdale/Fieldston, which is home to 106,924 residents, is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in New York City. The area struggles with healthy food accessibility, as evidenced by a supermarket-to-bodega ratio of 1:10 and a 14.2% food insecurity rate. Health behaviors are concerning, with a notable percentage of adults not consuming daily fruits and vegetables and a high rate of sugary drink consumption.

In terms of health, obesity and diabetes are prevalent in the community. Economic stresses are evident, with a median household income slightly below the NYC average. There are significant percentages of the population living in poverty or facing housing related financial burdens. The neighborhood has lower air pollution levels than the city average but lacks bicycle network coverage. On the up side, the community excels in green space and canopy coverage, surpassing the rest of the Bronx and NYC average. Canopy coverage refers to the percentage of an area that is covered by the leafy, upper layer of trees, providing shade and contributing to the urban environment’s green space. The Riverdale/Fieldston neighborhood has lower air pollution levels than the city average. 

Overall, the Foodscape Reports highlight the neighborhood's unique food insecurity challenges in food security and health, underscoring the need for targeted community-level interventions.
