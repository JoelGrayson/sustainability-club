# Meeting with Nicole De Santis from Think Zero

Brought in Think Zero to discuss Riverdale's waste audit and ways to reduce Riverdale's waste

### Sustainability Club
* Avoiding waste is better than composting.
* School goals
	* Get better at sorting
	* Smaller portion sizes
* Local composting > city


### EcoVendor
* 1/3 of garbage is from food waste
* City waste is right now used for biogas, although that will change
* Compostables are problematic because single-use and many are unable to be composted
	* Whereas rigid plastics can be recycled, compostables that look like plastic cannot be composted, so they end up in the landfill, meaning they are worse for the environment than plastic.
	* Fiber-based compostables may be able to be thrown out and composted. **I need to ask DSNY to confirm that they can be thrown into the orange bins.**
* Next year, restaurants can be fined for breaking stop the **â€Œ**
* Governor's Island has an example of a proper local composting site
* Nicole and Think Zero ran an event where there were food carts. They provided cutlery and plates which they washed after the event.
* Think Zero is the heart of it all
	* Nicole spoke on WNYC
	* Nicole met with head of DSNY
	* An employee worked in the Mayor De Blasio's environmental department previously
	* Nicole knows the head of Deliver Zero
