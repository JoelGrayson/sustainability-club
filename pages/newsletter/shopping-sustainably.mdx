# Shopping Sustainably

Hi Upper School ![üõç](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f6cd/72.png)![‚ôªÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/267b_fe0f/72.png)

In this week‚Äôs email, we wanted to address the ever-pressing concern of how to shop  sustainably.

As rapidly changing trends guide our purchases, overconsumption is continuously encouraged, and brands utilize deceptive marketing strategies to engage shoppers, we face a daunting question: How can we promote environmentally-conscious fashion practices?

It is crucial to understand the social and environmental impacts of our purchases. To learn more, check out [this website](https://goodonyou.eco/) that rates and gives information on how  sustainable  your favorite brands are!

One solution to combat harmful practices is through shopping secondhand. Secondhand shopping conserves resources, reduces waste, and allows communities to access locally sourced materials. In addition to thrifting in person, Apps like Depop, Threadup, and Vestaire Collective provide various prices and types of items.

A great way to dispose of your fashion faux pas is through Riverdale‚Äôs bright green donation bin behind 9/10. Approximately 85% of donated clothing ends up in a landfill, but this bin is another attempt to give textiles a new life. All forms of textiles can be donated here in any condition as long as they are dry. These textiles will then be sorted into what can be responsibly donated or recycled otherwise.
